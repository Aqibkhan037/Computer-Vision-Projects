# Computer-Vision-Projects
🖼️ Computer Vision Projects & Labs

Welcome to my Computer Vision repository! 🚀
This repo contains a collection of projects, labs, and experiments that I’ve worked on while learning and applying concepts in Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

📌 What’s Inside?

This repository will include:

🔍 Fundamental CV Labs – convolution, cross-correlation, Gaussian filters, thresholding, etc.

🤖 Deep Learning Models – CNNs, transfer learning, object detection.

📷 Image Processing Projects – edge detection, noise removal, image segmentation.

🧠 Applied Projects – real-world computer vision applications.

🎯 Goals

Build a solid foundation in classical image processing.

Explore deep learning-based CV models.

Share reproducible code and well-documented projects.

Create a portfolio of work that shows progress from basics to advanced topics.

📚 Learning Path

This repo follows a structured path:

Image Basics → Pixels, channels, transformations.

Filters → Gaussian, Sobel, Laplacian, edge detection.

Segmentation → Thresholding, region growing, clustering.

Object Detection → YOLO, Faster R-CNN.

Advanced Topics → TinyML, real-time CV applications.

🤝 Contributing

I’ll be updating this repo as I learn and build more.
